/*I'm alone most of the time.  I don't have anyone to collaborate with or share my ideas.  I'm frustrated, angry.  I've got really solid ideas - really marketable ones - but finding someone who I can share the passion of tabletop game design with... it's proved impossible.  I've tried so hard to do work on my own; but without anyone to share with, to drive me, for me to inspire, to acquire feedback from - without anyone with which to share the vision - what's the point?  It's like I feel hope falling away.*/
